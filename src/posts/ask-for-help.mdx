I'm mentoring a good friend's brother. He just graduated and he's hoping to land a tech job, so we're working on interview prep with a focus on data structures and algos.

And I have to keep saying to him: ask for help. Ask me when you have a problem. Ask me when you have a question about how an algorithm works. Tell me when you want to do a mock interview.
