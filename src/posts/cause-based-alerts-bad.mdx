A common anti-pattern I see is teams writing _cause-based_ alerts instead of
_symptom-based_ alerts.

Imagine a very simple webapp: You have a server which accepts HTTP requests,
talks to a database, does some work, and sends back a response. This is a toy
example but it generalizes pretty easily.

If the database slows down, should you alert? It's understandable to think so:
if the database is slow, the webapp is slow, and if the webapp is slow, you'll
lose user engagement. But if that's the case, why not just alert on the webapp
being slow? It's entirely possible for some database operations to slow down
but for that to not affect real user-observed performance. In that case, who cares!

_"But Ben, the database slowing down is a leading indicator for degraded user
performance! I want to know when something is going to go wrong!"_

You know what? That's fair. But you'd better have damn good reason to believe that
the user experience degrades _every_ time the database slows down, or you're setting
yourself up for failure. Soon you'll be waking up at 3 AM to a database performance
alert that doesn't matter to your user journeys, and shortly after that you'll be
ignoring database pages altogether. At that point, the only thing the alert
accomplishes is degrading your quality of life.
