My timer is my favorite tool. It helps me get more done than any other tool,
by a pretty large margin. I use timers mainly for two things: **working**
and **resting**.

_(Well, and cooking, but that's not as interesting.)_

### Working

I don't want to write Yet Another Pomodoro Articleâ„¢. But if you haven't heard
of it, the [Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)
is a method of time management. It's pretty simple: you set a timer, usually for
15, 20, or 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break when it's done. After 4 work
periods, take a longer break.

I am a devout believer in the Pomodoro Technique. I use the [Flow App](https://flowapp.info/)
as my timer. I resisted the Pomodoro Technique for years, but I immediately saw
a 2-3x increase in my weekly output once I started using it (seriously!). If
you're having trouble focusing consistently, set a timer and set the intention
to focus on your work until it goes off. The results will shock you.

### Resting

Resting is my other big use-case for my timer. If I lie down to close my eyes
-- usually with some white noise in the background -- I often find myself
checking the time to make sure I'm not wiling away my entire day. After doing
this long enough, I noticed my rests weren't truly restful because I was stressing
about keeping track of time.

Enter the timer. With a timer set, I can actually rest becasue I have nothing
to pay attention to. With my phone on silent except my alarm and some white noise
on, a 30-minute rest leaves me feeling completely recharged and ready for
the afternoon.

I realize that "set an alarm for your naps" isn't exactly
a ground-breaking idea. But I'm focusing specifically on how much more restful
it makes the time spent napping, not on the general time management principle of
"don't nap for an arbitrarily long time in the middle of your day."
