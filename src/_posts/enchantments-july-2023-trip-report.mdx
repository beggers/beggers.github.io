For July 4th this year, I went backpacking with some friends in [The
Enchantments](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/enchantment-lakes), one of the
most beautiful and hard-to-get-permits-for areas in the US.

We only had a [Colchuck Lake](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake)
permit, so we camped on the lake for four nights. Days 1 and 5 were hiking in
and out, days 2 and 4 were lake days, and day 3 was a tough day hike up
Aasgard pass. Our group was 7 -- a big group for a backpacking trip! This
made the trip really fun but caused a few coordination issues (more on those later).

### Lake days

Colchuck Lake is incredible. The weather was a balmy 70-80 degrees every day
we were there and the water was perfect at around 45 degrees. I didn't filter
my water; I drank it straight from the source. Since I knew we were planning to
spend some time at the lake I packed up an inner tube too. Very, very worth it.

When I spend time chilling in nature (as opposed to pounding miles on a
hike, crushing a ski day, etc) I'm always amazed at how my sense of time slows
down. I couldn't even tell you how we passed those two days other than having fun
in the sun, playing cards, and swimming, but they both felt like they flew right
by.

### Aasgard Pass

### Lessons learned

The trip wasn't all perfect.
