For July 4th this year, I went backpacking with some friends in [The
Enchantments](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/enchantment-lakes), one of the
most beautiful and hard-to-get-permits-for areas in the US.

We only had a [Colchuck Lake](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake)
permit, so we camped on the lake for four nights. Days 1 and 5 were hiking in
and out, days 2 and 4 were lake days, and day 3 was a tough day hike up
Aasgard pass. Our group was 7 -- a big group for a backpacking trip! This
made the trip really fun but caused a few coordination issues (more on those later).

### Lake days

Colchuck Lake is incredible. The weather was a balmy 70-80 degrees every day
we were there and the water was perfect at around 45 degrees. I didn't filter
my water; I drank it straight from the source. Since I knew we were planning to
spend some time at the lake I packed up an inner tube too. Very, very worth it.

When I spend time chilling in nature (as opposed to pounding miles on a
hike, crushing a ski day, etc) I'm always amazed at how my sense of time slows
down. I couldn't even tell you how we passed those two days other than having fun
in the sun, playing cards, and swimming, but they both felt like they flew right
by.

### Aasgard Pass

Aasgard Pass is one of the more challenging ascents I have done in my backpacking
career. You gain nearly 2,000 feet in less than 1 mile; for context, I usually
think of a "real" incline as being at least 300 feet per mile, and a steep incline
as being >= 500 feet per mile.

We had an incredible day hiking and glissading around the Core Enchantments and
resting by Perfection Lake.

Coming down Aasgard Pass was another story. The steepness, loose rocks and dirt,
lack of clear trail, and my exhaustion from all the hiking that day made the descent
a serious ordeal. I slipped, fell, and slid multiple times, scratching up my
arms and legs and frequently reopening a slice on my right pinky. I missed
the trail and cliffed out mid-descent, forcing me to backtrack several hundred
feet of elevation gain (and wasting about 30 minutes). By the time I reached
the bottom, my right hand was covered in blood, the rest of me was covered in
dirt, sweat, and bruises, and even the relatively flat hike back to camp
felt nigh-insurmountable.

### Lessons learned

Despite the misery of descending Aasgard Pass, I don't think I would do anything
differently about that day except perhaps look more carefully for cairns! In
seriousness: in the future I will do challenging day hikes to get the most out
of being in beautiful places. And all things considered, I was adequately prepared
for the hike.

However, we did have some issues with food on the trip. We planned our food as a
group and while we nailed our three major meals every day, some people in the
group (including me!) were woefully underprepared on snacks. I've thought about
the root causes of this, and I believe it boils down to a lack of clear ownership:
I packed out four meals for the entire group, weighing in total much more than the
food I would have brought for just myself, and was assured that there were plenty of
snacks. However, other people only heard that they needed to bring snacks for
themselves and some underestimated their snack needs on top of that, so we were overall
very short on snacks. This made my trip tough since I need to eat lots of snacks
(large body, fast metabolism, small stomach) and I didn't have a bank of snacks
to call my own.

For all future
backpacking trips, I plan to make sure I am packing out all the food I intend
to eat so that I can look at my food bag and estimate whether I have enough or not.
