A manager I used to work with, long before I saw the light of the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique),
suggested
I start each week by writing down a list of things I wanted to accomplish sorted
by order of importance. He recommended I then ignore almost everything else and
execute tasks from the list sequentially. He claimed that over time I
would develop a good intuition for my weekly output and be able to construct my
task lists accordingly.

While I don't use his proposed weekly planning cadence, I do divide my work into
planning work vs execution work. I've come to call these "smart mode" and
"dumb mode", respectively.

### Smart mode

Smart mode is all about deciding what to do. Most often, I use smart mode to
build lists of tasks to be done, as opposed to doing tasks themselves. Smart mode
is for strategizing, breaking off discrete chunks of work, and getting them written
down somewhere.

### Dumb mode

Dumb mode--or sometimes "robot mode"--is for executing tasks. When I decide
to be in dumb mode for a 25-minute Pomodoro session, I start the work session
by deciding which task(s) I want to focus on. Then I ignore Slack, my phone,
and anything else that might distract me and focus solely on those tasks. Most
importantly, I don't think about whether or not I'm doing the right work: I
corral all of those concerns into smart mode and deal with them there, so that
by the time I'm in dumb mode I'm confident that I want to accomplish the task
I'm working on.

### Balancing the two

As a certified Pomodoro Technique enjoyer, I do a shorter-feedback-loop version of
what he suggested: I usually do one smart mode flow for every 3-7 dumb mode
flows, and I really have found that I can pretty accurately estimate my output.
