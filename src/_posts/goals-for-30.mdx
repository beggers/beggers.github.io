For several years now, I have set my goals for the next year on my birthday (Feb 8).
These aren't binding, nor do I spend an inordinate amount of time ensuring that
I achieve them all with no adjustment or further introspection. But I find that
the exercise of specifying my goals helps me clarify what I should spend my
time doing, why, and how I can measure my success (if applicable). I try to
make them as concrete as possible.

- **Continue running with a coach and do all prescribed workouts, skipping no more
  than one every 3 weeks**. Running is really good for me. I have always wanted
  to be a runner and I finally figured out how to prevent my shin splints. Working
  with [Mark](https://teamrunrun.com/coach/mark-cliggett-seattle-running-coach/) has helped my consistency a lot and he is a font of wisdom. "Skipping"
  means deciding not to do it as planned--if I have e.g. a backpacking trip and
  know I won't be able to run, that doesn't count as skipping.
- **Meditate for at least 30 minutes daily, at least 5 days per week**. Meditation
  is good for me. I know it's good for me. My practice has been lacking lately
  (for good reasons!) but I want to get back to it. 30 minutes is doable, and
  aiming for 5 days per week gives me enough slack. I'm holding this one lightly--
  it's clear that I need to reintegrate a mindfulness practice into my life, but
  meditation can sometimes become yet another thing I bludgeon myself with rather
  than an expansive and invigorating activity.
- **Drink no more than twice per week**. 2x weekly is still a little high, but
  it's lower than my current alcohol consumption. I'm bad at abrupt drastic
  changes but this seems like a doable way to take better care of my body.
- **Get at least two hours of flow time per workday**. As a senior engineer,
  I produce a good amount of value by mentoring, having opinions in meetings,
  and other "soft" ways. But, I need to make sure I spend at least two hours per
  workday focusing on artefacts so that I don't lose sight of my goals as a
  builder and engineer. Plus I really prefer focused heads-down work.
- **Become an expert at something at work**. Work-related goals are hard because
  I haven't started my new job yet. But by the time my 1-year anniversary rolls
  around, I want to be recognized within my org as an expert on some topic related
  to our core business. This will enable my continued career and technical growth.
- **Eat more at home: 5x each meal weekly**. I really let my eating habits get
  out of hand while I was working and in grad school. Now that I will once again
  have some stability and free time (goodbye school), I can take care of myself
  by preparing more of my meals by myself. 5x each meal weekly is high enough
  that I need to have a real cooking habit and spend a lot of time in my kitchen,
  but not so high as to be restrictive of the times I want to go out.
- **Read for at least 5 hours per week**. My goodreads profile says my goal is to
  read 52 books this year. But I've noticed that incentivizes me to read shorter
  books and makes me procrastinate, especially now that I've started to get behind.
  Instead, I'm setting the intention here to read for at least 5 hours per week:
  a relatively modest amonut which will still require I make time for it. I don't
  know if this is the right way to set a reading goal, or if reading goals even
  work for me.
- **Up my style game**. I've wanted a style refresh for several years now. It's
  time to put in the time and spend the money to look better and feel better
  with how I present myself.

In summary: Run, focus, and be mindful of what's going into my body.

You may notice I don't have any social or travel plans here. That's because I've
found I don't need to set any goals with those: I see my friends very frequently
and travel often. I have 8 weddings to attend this year, only one of which is
in my city! So I don't think there's value there.
