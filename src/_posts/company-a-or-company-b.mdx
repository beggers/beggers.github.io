*UPDATE (2023 Feb 2): I took the offer from Company B! I can't wait to start
at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/).*

I have a big career question coming up: **do I want my next role to be a customer-
facing product engineering role, or do I want to continue to work in infrastructure
and reliability**?

I have been interviewing at two companies, either of which I would be very happy
to work at. Company A is a little bit larger, with an infra org of ~70 engineers,
and wants me to help them build out their reliability and best practices. Company
B is smaller (500ish folks total) and wants me on their Growth team, working
on their entire product surface across their entire stack to increase user
conversions and engagement. Assuming the offers are comparable, here are my
pros and cons for each:

### Company A

Like I said, Company A is a bit bigger than Company B. Furthermore, they've recently
signed an agreement to be acquired by a large public company. Everyone there seems
to believe it will stay independent ("A GitHub/Microsoft situation") but of course
that might not happen.

#### Pros

* Stabiilty. Company A is larger and more established, and will soon have the
  backing of a very large public company. They've been immune to the recent wave
  of layoffs.
* Working on reliabiilty. Company A wants me to build out their incident management
  processes and relatedly work in Reliability. This is my wheelhouse and something
  that I enjoy. It would also give me lots of great fodder for this blog.
* Leadership. Related to the above, I would be in a formally leader-shaped
  position at Company A, which could be awesome for my career. A promotion to
  Staff seems possible within a few years.
* Manager. I loved the hiring manager for Company A: they seemed like a lovely
  and empathetic human being who cared deeply about their reports and their org
  health.
* Organizational empathy. This is a bit hard to define, but I get the feeling
  that Company A has a good culture of caring for one another. My interviewers
  were all very kind and asked if I needed a break, my recruiter made sure to
  have a final chat with me after my onsites, and I have the feeling overall
  that human empathy is a tenet of the culture.

#### Cons

* Slowness. Company A has moved slowly at times during our interview process,
  leaving me impatient. In general it's a larger and more established organization,
  which means much more process and inertia.
* Career pigeonholing. If I continue down the Reliability career path, especially
  now that I'm a senior engineer, I will likely start blogging about it and going
  to conferences. This might lock my brand as an engineer into "Reliability Guy,"
  which I might not want.
* Less financial upside. Assuming the acquisition goes through (and even if it
  doesn't, really), the stock portion of my compensation will be much less
  likely to 10x or even 5x.

### Company B

Company B is smaller headcount-wise by about 1/2 but has a valuation of approximately 1/5
Company A's. I'm not sure if this is a testament to Company A's massive success
or Company B's growth/industry being more tepid. Company B is a fintech shop
that a good friend works at; they have only good things to say about the
leadership and culture.

#### Pros

* Faster. Company B seems to move much more quickly--not just in the hiring process
  but, based on what my friend says, as an engineering organization.
* Financial upside. Company B could still 5x, 10x, or even 20x in valuation. The
  absolute best-case scenario obviously isn't very likely, but it's nice to dream.
* A new path. On the Growth team, I'd be doing a lot of frontend work in addition
  to my usual backend experience. I would also be doing direct product engineering,
  which I've never done before in my career. Sometimes I think I would enjoy
  my career more if I worked on things which customers and end-users engaged
  with directly. It would certainly open up more doors for my next gig.
* Less BS. Nobody at Company B has tried to BS me about anything: they've been
  very forthcoming with when they'll get back to me, and the offer process was
  extemely no-nonsense (to the point where I maybe would have liked a little more
  of a sales pitch!).

#### Cons

* Immediate money. Company A is offering a slightly higher base salary and equity
  that is immediately liquid. Because Company B is in the growth stage, it's
  possible my equity will be worthless.
* Less "cool" factor. Company B is less well-known and less exciting to talk about.
  People perk up at the mention of Company A. I'm not sure I really care about this.
* Career growth. It's not as clear to me what career growth looks like at Company
  B, especially since I would be switch to a new career track. I would probably
  sit at my current level for a long time. Then again, I would be a part of
  a rapidly growing company which could put me in new and exciting places.

### Conclusion

I'm really not sure where I'll go. Mostly, I'm thrilled to receive two competitive
offers in this job market. I believe I'll make either one work well for me, but
I can't help but feel like this decision will have ramifications for the rest of
my career.

Maybe I should hike the CDT this summer instead of either. Who knows.
