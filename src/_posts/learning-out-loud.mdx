As this website gets closer and closer to launch, I've noticed a growing anxiety
around it. As best I can tell, it's because everything I say here feels so
public and so *permanent*.

At work I have the freedom to change my mind
on a topic. Maybe I have to communicate a little more around my new opinions
and beliefs, but the psychological environment is (usually!) one where everyone
wants what's best for the company and its individuals, so changing beliefs is
more welcome. Perhaps more importantly, these types of conversations at work
happen with a relatively static group of people over a long period of time. This
means that trust can be nurtured with healthy and respectful disagreement, and by
accepting when people change their minds. In other words, it's in everyone's best
interest to be kind and accepting of the facts that sometimes people are wrong,
and sometimes people change their minds.

The public internet feels like a completely different ballgame. People love to
poke holes, argue, and point out inconsistencies. If someone reads one of my
posts and disagrees, they aren't incentivized to give a measured and compassionate
response; they'll probably score more points on Hacker News or Twitter by posting
a snarky, cutting takedown. Incisive rhetoric has its uses but I think the internet
overindexes on it as an indicator of intelligence and clout.

I'm committed to being wrong, changing my beliefs, and learning out loud. If
people want to score points off of that, that's okay with me.
