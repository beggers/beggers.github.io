### Purpose

I've mentored several people from my network who hope to break into software
engineering or who want to level up their software engineering career. I find
myself having similar preliminary conversations with them about how our
mentor/mentee relationship can work and how, in my mind, it _should_ work to
best serve them.

I'm writing this post to clarify my thoughts on how to structure an effective
mentor/mentee relationship and provide a crisp starting point for future
conversations.

### What I can actually do for you

Realistically, I can't do as much as many of my mentees seem to hope. I can't
turn you into a software wizard overnight. I certainly can't get you a job,
though I will happily connect you with people I know if you work hard. I can't
even make you any better at programming: only you can do that.

So what can I do? I can be your tutor and friend and maybe even therapist a
little bit. It sounds corny, but that's really all I can do. I can help you find
gaps in your knowledge and skills, offer exercises and practice to work on them,
and listen when you're frustrated. I can help you make a decision about what to
focus on this week and help you lay out your resume. I can do a million small
things to support you, but I can't do the one thing you actually really want,
which is to make you better at programming. You have to do that.

### You're in charge

Seriously, it's your rodeo and I'm a supporting actor. And since I neither want
nor ask compensation, I'm not going to treat this like a job. If you stop
reaching out to schedule practice interviews or code reviews or office hours,
I'll assume you want to take a break. In practice, of _course_ I'll check in on
you if I haven't heard from you in a couple weeks. But you have to be the one
pushing this forward: I can't do it for you. (Are you noticing a theme here?)

### I can only work as hard as you do

I have my career and projects that I'm working on -- they occupy most of my
mental space and energy. I've found that for the most part, I can make something
in my career or personal life go well if I just work really really hard at it. I
can't do that with mentoring you; I can't work any harder than you do. If I
spend time every weekend thinking of interesting problems that I think will
challenge you but you don't spend time working on them, we make no progress. The
opposite is _not_ true: if you spend a lot of time and energy working on your
software skills and I don't, you'll still have skills at the end! Your work
determines our success much more than anything else.

If you feel you don't know how to work effectively or how to approach your work
in a way that motivates you to work hard, that's a different question. Helping
you be happily productive is definitely part of my job here. And, shameless
plug, I plan to write about those two topics in the <code> productivity</code>
and <code> mindset</code> tags, respectively.
