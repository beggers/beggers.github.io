### Purpose

I've mentored several people from my network who hope to break into software
engineering or who want to level up their software engineering career. I find
myself having similar preliminary conversations with them about how our
mentor/mentee relationship can work and how, in my mind, it _should_ work to best
serve them.

I'm writing this post to clarify my thoughts on how to structure an effective
mentor/mentee relationship and provide a crisp starting point for future conversations.
That said, here are some disorganized pieces of advice for anyone using me
as a mentor.

### You're in charge

### I can only work as hard as you do

### Be realistic

### Do your damn homework
