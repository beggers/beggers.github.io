# My website.

This is my website. I want to learn frontend development, since I embarrassingly have never
built a website in my 6+ years of professional software engineering. To that end, I'm
using Astro for the content templating and Tailwind for css, and otherwise using vanilla
JS (though this may change).

# Roadmap

Things I want to add, and the order in which I want to add them:

- Recent posts on landing page.

- Post template which can return you to the landing page. Maybe a global header? Seems excessive.

- All posts page to landing page.

- Posts by tag to footer (maybe all posts here too?).

- Styling.

- Hit tracking.

- Subscribe with email address to any subset of post tags.
