I'm a decent engineer, but I spend most of my time thinking about what it means to live well and take care of the people around me. To that end I sometimes write about engineering, but I also write about life in general.

Why do I have a personal website at all? Because the web used to be weird, before corporations started relentlessly monetizing such concepts as "interacting with your friends" and "being part of a community." This is a small act of nostalgia and defiance.

I thought it would be fun to make this an "upside-down" website: pages don't have paths ("beneggers.com/posts/example") but instead exist as subdomains (example.posts.beneggers.com). This was a lot of work but, on the other hand, it makes the website slower and have worse SEO.
