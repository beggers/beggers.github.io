Hi! My name is Ben Eggers -- I'm also known as beggers and (occasionally) cantbechoosers. I like to hike long distances (PCT '22), make music, throw and attend weird parties, and cook for my friends. In past chapters of life I have been a therapist and, separately, a Mandarin/English transalator. These days I work as a Staff Software Engineer at OpenAI.

I'm in a tryhard phase of my career so I use this website to clarify my thoughts about how to be a more effective engineer. If you know me outside of work you'll probably find everything here pretty boring!

I thought it would be fun to make this an "upside-down" website: pages don't have paths but instead exist as subdomains. This took a decent amount of work for no benefit whatsoever.
