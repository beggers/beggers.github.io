## About me
I like to hike long distances (PCT '22), make music, throw and attend weird parties, and cook for my friends. In past chapters of life I have been a therapist and, separately, a Mandarin/English transalator. These days I work as a Staff Software Engineer at OpenAI.

## About this website
Why do I have a personal website at all? Because the web used to be weird, before corporations started relentlessly monetizing such concepts as "interacting with your friends" and "being part of a community." This is a small act of nostalgia and defiance.

I thought it would be fun to make this an "upside-down" website: pages don't have paths ("beneggers.com/posts/example") but instead exist as subdomains (example.posts.beneggers.com). This was a lot of work but, on the other hand, it makes the website slower and have worse SEO.
