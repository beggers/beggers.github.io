We've all done it: "You haven't heard of _Bon Jovi_?"[^1]. It's a common reaction when someone reveals that they don't know about something which seems _so famous_ and _so obvious_ that you can't believe anyone could possibly not have heard of it. It's a scourge.

[^1] Or some other artist, bakery, brand, person, ...

I once had an excellent coworker -- the kind who makes everyone work harder and be kinder to each other just by being around -- who called this "faux incredulity." I most often heard him use those words in the sentence, "My goal is for nobody on our team to ever react with faux incredulity."

At the time, as a snotty smart kid fresh out of college, I didn't fully understand. What's so bad about giving people a little shit for not knowing something they obviously should know about? But over time, especially when I was in school to become a therapist, avoiding faux incredulity in my self-expression has become very important to me.

It accomplishes nothing besides giving the person expressing faux incredulity a small sense of superiority. It makes the person on the receiving end feel neutral at best; belittled, stupid, and like they're in an out-group at worst. It burns psychological safety in service of the speaker's ego. I hope you'll join me in pointing out to others when they express faux incredulity and encouraging them to rethink whether it's the best way to express themselves.

_Of course, there's an [obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1053/) for this._
